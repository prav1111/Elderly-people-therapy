      <h2>The Challenge of Elderly Care in India</h2>
      <p>
        In India, the elderly population is experiencing a significant rise,
        projected to increase from 8% in 2015 to 11.5% in 2025 and 19% by 2050.
        This demographic shift has led to a growing number of senior citizens
        residing in old age homes or living alone, especially in rural areas.
        These individuals often face multifaceted challenges, including:
      </p>

      <h3>Social Isolation and Loneliness</h3>
      <p>
        Many elderly individuals experience profound loneliness due to limited
        family interactions and reduced social networks. Studies indicate that
        the prevalence of severe loneliness in care homes can range from 22% to
        42%, compared to 10% in the community population.
      </p>

      <h3>Mental Health Issues</h3>
      <p>
        A significant portion of the elderly suffer from mental health
        conditions. The World Health Organization estimates that depressive
        disorders among the elderly vary between 10% and 20%, with higher rates
        observed among those who have lost partners and live alone.
      </p>

      <h3>Lack of Adequate Support Structures</h3>
      <p>
        Despite various government schemes aimed at protecting the elderly,
        there is a notable absence of dedicated policies and social structures
        to support those living alone or in old age homes, particularly in rural
        regions.
      </p>

      <p>
        These challenges underscore the urgent need for innovative solutions to
        address the emotional and psychological well-being of the elderly.
        Implementing AI-driven conversational agents could offer companionship
        and mental stimulation, potentially mitigating feelings of isolation and
        improving overall quality of life for seniors in old age homes and those
        living alone.
